# Quickstart

Welcome to the PushFeedback documentation!
In a few minutes, you'll have the PushFeedback widget up and running on your site.

## 1. Create your PushFeedback account

To use the PushFeedback widget, start by setting up your account:

1. Open [app.pushfeedback.com](https://app.pushfeedback.com).
2. Click on the **Sign Up** button located in the top bar.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to set up your account.

    ![Create account](./images/create-account.png)

With your account ready, move on to creating your first project.

## 2. Create a project

<div style={{ position: 'relative', paddingTop: '66.42%' }}>
<iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/1014981817?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; fullscreen; picture-in-picture; clipboard-write" style={{ position: 'absolute', top: 0, left: 0, width: '100%', height: '100%' }}></iframe></div>
<script src="https://player.vimeo.com/api/player.js"></script>

To create your first project, follow these steps:

1. In your PushFeedback dashboard, click the **Projects** tab in the top navbar.
2. Click the **Create project** button.
3. Step through the wizard, providing details about your project as prompted:

    1. **URL configuration:** Specify the URL where you intend to use the feedback widget. This URL must corresponds to the exact domain or subdomain where the widget will be used. For example, in our case we use `docs.pushfeedback.com` instead of `pushfeedback.com`.
    2. **Email notification setup (optional):** You have the option to define up to three email addresses that will receive notifications.
    3. **Get your code snippet**: The final step of the wizard shows your project code snippet, which contains your unique Project ID.
    
## 3. Add the widget to your site

To integrate the PushFeedback widget into your website:

1. Insert the following code within the `<head>` section of your site's HTML:

    ```html
    <!-- Initialize the PushFeedback widget -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/pushfeedback/dist/pushfeedback/pushfeedback.css">
    <script type="module" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/pushfeedback/dist/pushfeedback/pushfeedback.esm.js"></script>
    ```

    :::info
    The above method is the standard way of integrating the widget into an static HTML site. If you're using a particular web framework or content management system, PushFeedback offers tailored installation options and plugins. For detailed guides, refer to our [Installation](/category/installation) documentation.
    :::

1. Just before the closing `</body>` tag of your website's HTML, add the following snippet:

    ```html
    <feedback-button project="<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>" button-position="bottom-right" modal-position="bottom-right" button-style="dark">Feedback</feedback-button>
    ```

Replace `<YOUR_PROJECT_ID>` with your project's ID you obtained from the previous step.

## 4. Customize the widget

Get the PushFeedback widget to blend with your website's design and functionality. Here's a quick look at some customization options:

* **Layout:** Choose the widget's placement on your siteâ€”bottom right, top left, or even integrate it with an existing button.

* **Styles:** Modify colors, fonts, and more to ensure the widget harmonizes with your site's aesthetics.

* **Text:** Adapt the widget's text to mirror your site's tone or language.

For detailed configuration steps, see our [Configuration](/category/configuration) documentation.
